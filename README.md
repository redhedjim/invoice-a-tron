Goal for this app: The ability to create a report of all the time for each hospital for a given date range. And having a button to "lock" those time entires. 

From my reading, we can do this by just pulling all the time entries given a date range, show them in a pretty way and have one button. When you hit the button, it will generate invoices for all the hospitals given that data range. When the invoices are generated, harvest automagically locks all the time entires. Easy right?
